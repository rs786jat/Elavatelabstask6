# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation Report

## 📌 Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by testing different passwords against online password strength tools (e.g., [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)) and summarizing best practices for secure password creation.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **PasswordMeter.com** – Free online password strength checker  
- Other free password strength checkers (optional for cross-validation)

---

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:
   - Short/simple (e.g., `abc123`)
   - Medium complexity (e.g., `Abc123!`)
   - Long and complex (e.g., `T!m3$Tr0ngP@ssw0rd2025`)
2. Tested each password using password strength checkers.
3. Recorded scores and feedback.
4. Analyzed results to identify best practices.

## 📊 Results

| Password Example        | Length | Complexity | Score (PasswordMeter) | Feedback |
|--------------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------|----------|
| `abc123`                | 6      | Low        | ~32%                  | Too short, predictable, lacks symbols |
| `Abc123!`               | 7      | Medium     | ~62%                  | Better mix, but still short |
| `T!m3$Tr0ngP@ssw0rd2025`| 20     | High       | ~100%                  | Strong: long, mixed case, numbers, symbols |

## 🔎 Key Findings
- **Length matters**: Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.  
- **Character diversity**: Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases strength.  
- **Avoid dictionary words**: Common words or patterns are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.  
- **Randomness is key**: Predictable substitutions (like `P@ssw0rd`) are weaker than true randomness.  

---

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.  
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using lists of common words and variations to guess passwords.  
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked passwords from other sites to access accounts.  

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use **at least 12–16 characters**.  
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
- Avoid personal info (names, birthdays, etc.).  
- Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `Blue!Sky_2025RunsFast`) over single words.  
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store unique passwords.  
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.  

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Password strength tools provide useful feedback but should be combined with security awareness.  
- Complexity alone isn’t enough – **length and unpredictability** are critical.  
- Regularly updating passwords and avoiding reuse across sites reduces risk.  

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This evaluation improved understanding of password security and highlighted best practices for creating strong, resilient passwords against brute force and dictionary attacks.
